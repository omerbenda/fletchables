# Fletchables
A Minecraft mod which lets you use the fletching table to create various arrows

## Fletchables brings 3 new arrows to the game:
- The Explosive Arrow, capable of delivering a blast to your target
- The Ender Arrow, used for teleportation
- The Jump Arrow, which allows you to "rocket jump"



## New method of crafting arrows
The new arrows can be crafted in the fletching table - which now has its own GUI
