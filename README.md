- The Jump Arrow, which allows you to "rocket jump"
- The Twisting Arrow, turns your target's head around
- The Chorus Arrow, teleport your target to a random position close by

## New block:
- The Jump TNT can launch you into the air without leaving any mark

## New method of crafting arrows
The new arrows can be crafted in the fletching table - which now has its own GUI
